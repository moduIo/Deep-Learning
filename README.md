# Deep-Learning-Practice
Implementations for Deep Neural Networks on a variety of tasks.

## Word2Vec
Implements Word2Vec embedding layer using a sentiment analysis dataset and gensim.

## CIFAR-10
Implements a CNN for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
My model improves the baseline accuracy by 0.0539% to 0.8039% in 15 fewer epochs using Batch Normalization and Adam optimizer.

## Sentiment Analysis
Implements an LSTM for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset.
