## Word2Vec
Implementation Word2Vec embedding layer using the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset and gensim.

## Sentiment Analysis
Implementation of an LSTM in Keras for sentiment analysis on the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset.

Implementation of Bidirectional LSTM which improved accuracy from 0.8339 baseline to 0.87432.

## CIFAR-10
Implements a CNN in Keras for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
My model: 83.87% validation accuracy in 10 epochs, and 88.17% after 25 epochs.

## Reinforcement Learning
Implementation of Q-learning using the OpenAI Gym environment.

## Transfer Learning
Uses Inception model as a pretrained feature extractor on CIFAR-10.
